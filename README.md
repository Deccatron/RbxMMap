# 💉 RbxMMap – Advanced Manual Mapping Injector for Roblox

**RbxMMap** is a powerful, low-level DLL injector built specifically for Roblox using advanced manual mapping techniques.  
Though it's currently in a WIP (work-in-progress) state due to access violations, it lays a rock-solid foundation for building next-gen, stealthy injectors.

## ⚙️ Features

### 💉 Advanced Process Injection Methods
- Manual Mapping with relocation handling
- Reflective DLL injection support
- LoadLibraryW fallback injection
- Thread hijacking for stealth memory operations
- Optimized chunked memory writes (16–64 bytes)
- 10x retry logic for reliable memory writes

### 🔒 Anti-Debug & Security Bypass
- PEB manipulation to hide from user-mode debuggers
- Heap flag manipulation for anti-debug hardening
- API hooking to bypass standard debug checks
- Hardware breakpoint detection and removal
- Thread hiding from common debugging tools
- Patches for:
  - `TaskSpawn` (0x10DD3C0) – prevents thread-based detection
  - `RequestCode` (0xA120E0) – bypasses memory validation
  - `LockViolationInstanceCrash` (0x5A91678) – avoids memory write crashes

### 🛡️ Memory Protection & Manipulation
- VirtualProtect memory permission control
- Custom retry logic for stable memory writing
- Polymorphic shellcode generation for evasion
- Simplified `WriteProcessMemory` for better performance
- Access violation handling with delayed retries (15ms)

### 🔍 Process Analysis & Control
- Target process enumeration + PID detection
- Full thread enumeration and remote thread control
- Privilege checks for injection readiness
- Updated Roblox Hyperion base address reference: `0x7ffdf0a00000`

### 📝 Logging & Error Handling
- File-based error logs for crash diagnostics
- Real-time console output with status updates
- Exception catching for key failure points
- Operation timing and intelligent retry delays
- Cleaner error message formatting

### 🧩 Code Structure
- Clean and modular C++ codebase
- Integrated low-level Windows APIs
- Custom NT definitions (no extra libs required)
- Easy to extend and customize
- Code randomization support for anti-detection
- Improved reliability via intelligent retry logic

## 🚧 Current Status

The injector is **not yet stable** due to **access violation issues**, but it's already packed with robust architecture and defense bypass techniques.  
A perfect base for:
- Fixing internal crashes
- Experimenting with different injection methods
- Learning about memory manipulation and manual mapping

## 🛠️ Disclaimer

This project is a near-complete implementation of an advanced manual mapping injector tailored for Roblox.  
While it currently experiences access violation issues, it’s designed as a **Swiss army knife for memory injection** — packed with powerful features, modular structure, and robust bypasses.  
Perfect as a learning resource or a solid base to build your own stealthy injection tool.
